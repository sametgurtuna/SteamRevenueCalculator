      <h3>Tax Rates</h3>
      <h4>Turkey Tax:</h4>
      <p>In Turkey, tax rate is generally 20%.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>United States Tax:</h4>
      <p>
        Developers may be based in different countries and pay income taxes
        based on a myriad of circumstances. There is also VAT, that is included
        in the price in a lot of countries, and can be 5% to 25% depending on
        the country. So I've just picked a rough number of 30% as the default,
        and I will add the ability to fine-tune it in the future.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Steam Cut:</h4>
      <p>
        Steam takes its 30% cut, although some developers may have negotiated a
        smaller cut, for example for exclusivity. But this number is probably
        the standard for indie game developers.

      <h3>Boxleiter Method</h3>
      <p>
        The Boxleiter method is a statistical method used for analyzing the
        distribution of a dataset.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is commonly used to determine the normal distribution of a dataset
        and uncover specific trends or patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Steam Revenue Calculator, this method allows users to estimate
        revenue based on either the number of sales or the number of reviews.
